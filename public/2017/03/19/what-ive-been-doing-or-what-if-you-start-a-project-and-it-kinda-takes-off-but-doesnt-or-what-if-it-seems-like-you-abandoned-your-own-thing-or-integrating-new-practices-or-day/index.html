<p>For the first 5 weeks or so of 2017, <a href="https://github.com/jwithington/100-days-of-healthing/graphs/commit-activity" target="_blank">I committed a whole lot</a> to my #<a href="https://github.com/jwithington/100-days-of-healthing" target="_blank">100DaysOfHealthing repo</a>. The project buzzed around my head, I set up my work computer to launch Git Bash every day when I logged in, and <a href="http://selfcare.tech/" target="_blank">folks that I admire</a> even added me to their <a href="https://github.com/jenniferlynparsons/selfcaretech/pull/36" target="_blank">own projects</a>.</p>

<p>And then hey look at that, it was February, and a lot of good things were happening in my personal life&#8211;health things shaking out, finances slowly but kinda surely improving, meditating every day (not just three minutes at a time, but 10 minutes, even! Thanks <a href="https://www.headspace.com" target="_blank">Headspace</a> !), and going to acupuncture regularly. I took baths a lot more with the help of the &#8220;podcast bath kit&#8221; my girlfriend bought me for Christmas. I helped promote self-care at work and at home. I had encouraging things for other folks who were participating.</p>

<p>And then, the commits dried up.</p>

<p>I feel a responsibility to explain that, and also like the idea of showing how <em>this kind of shift</em> can be positive, too. So here goes.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-not-your-projects">You are not your projects</h2>

<p>You know what would suck? If <strong><em>trying to get one self-care hour a day stressed you the fuck out</em></strong>. If trying to make time to track a self-care hour <em>in itself made you miss or long for self-care</em>. If &#8220;update self-care log&#8221; because a niggling, nagging task, instead of a joyous way to track amazing steps!</p>

<p>Did this happen to me? No way. But as I started updating three, four, seven days all in a batch, I realized something:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was more important to me to live a life that included self-care (and promotion of self-care) than it was to do little updates every day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cop out? Hmm.</p>

<p><code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>

<p>But here&#8217;s a list of things that have happened since my last commit to the repo:</p>

<ul>
<li>For my birthday, my girlfriend, dog, and <strong>I took a screenless weekend on the Washington coast</strong>. This included a lot of taking baths, reading, and not much else. I wanted a pause, and I got one, and it was like a self-care boot camp reset.<sup id="fnref-32-1"><a href="#fn-32-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p></li>

<li><p>I learned that <strong>I no longer wanted to use my phone as my alarm</strong>. Weird? I dunno, but hear me out: screenless weekend meant my phone wasn&#8217;t the last thing I saw at light&#8217;s out or the first thing I saw when waking up. I no longer could get sucked in to distractions at the time when my mind is most apt (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MpRt41tPoc" target="_blank">apt!</a>) to fill with distraction.</p></li>

<li><p>So I bought a [Pebble Time][pebble]. This, too, was huge. Now I had an alarm that would wake me up silently, more easily, and without HEY HERE&#8217;S ALL THE COOL PHONE THINGS YOU CAN DO staring at me from moment one. I can walk the dog without my phone as a step tracker. I have a thing that lives on my body that maybe is a bit less accurate but more realistic in telling me when I was <em>actually</em> sleeping.</p></li>

<li><p>I continued working out some medication stuff that&#8217;s important.</p></li>

<li><p>I had some mini-breakthroughs in therapy and at acupuncture.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These seem positive to me. And (maybe with the exception of a gadget, even a well-thought out one) it seems like ongoing self-care, too.</p>

<h2 id="unstructured-time">Unstructured Time</h2>

<p>I never take any. If I think of the kind of thing where I actively just&#8230;hang out? Watch a random movie? Read a magazine and just drink coffee, or even just go out for coffee without a Task At Hand? I hardly ever do these things.</p>

<p>And my therapist (who rules) and I keep coming back to that. I always feel <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/251" target="_blank">time-constrained</a>, and I also always feel like &#8220;this time right here has to have something going on.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, in a way, I&#8217;ve been doing more self-care during #100DaysOfHealthing. I just haven&#8217;t always planned, executed and recorded it.</p>

<p>I hope that&#8217;s true for you as well.</p>

<p>And I know that I have a loooong way to go improve my relationship with myself and others, but the self-care part has landed in a good spot.</p>

<h2 id="now-what">Now What?</h2>

<p>Well, a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I still consider the project to be underway, for me, and for any of you that are still doing it.</p></li>

<li><p>In the future, for the project, I&#8217;m going to consider finding a way to make tracking days a lot simpler / more &#8220;on the fly&#8221;. Because stressing out about tracking self-care is super unproductive.</p></li>

<li><p>At some point we will reach 100 days! And then maybe, later in the year, I&#8217;ll do a relaunch of the project.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But for now, know this: I&#8217;m supporting myself by taking time for self-care. I hope you are, too.</p>

<p>❤️</p>

<p>p.s. I wrote this about two weeks ago, but didn&#8217;t quite post it then. I think it all still stands though. 😀 Today, March 18, is Day 75, if you&#8217;re counting.</p>
