# Biography

I'm a Software Engineer focused on Front End web development and skilled in building responsive React components, maintaining legacy code, static site generators,and accurate documentation. A quick and thorough learner and perceptive communicator, I'm always looking to learn the next interesting thing. 

## How I got here

I've lived in Portland, Oregon, since 2005, and in that time I've coached students, taught art and writing courses, and worked in customer support. After years of simply being a technology fan, I fell in love with the simplicity of markdown and decided to learn to code.

That simplicity still drives what I do. I like clean lines and building websites that are easy to update and maintain. Letâ€™s build something together!
