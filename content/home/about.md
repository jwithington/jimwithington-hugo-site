# Biography

I've lived in Portland, Oregon, since 2005, and in that time I've coached students, taught art and writing courses, and worked in customer support. After years of mostly being a technology fan, I fell in love with the simplicity of markdown and decided to learn to code.

That simplicity still drives what I do. I like clean lines and building websites that are easy to update and maintain. Letâ€™s build something together!
